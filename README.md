A custom RISC virtual machine I am writing for an AI project.

Symbios AI is a research project into non-guided genetic algorithms. Usually when working with a genetic algorithm, you set the standards for what is considered a good result for the AI. However, with Symbios AI there will be no standard provided by the programmer.

Instead, each AI is composed of two AI which have a symbiotic relationship with each other. One AI is responsible for accquiring memory for the other AI to live in, along with interactions with the other AI pairs via a shared memory space. The other AI is responsible for determining which other AI pairs are acceptible mates for producing the next generation of AI.


While I have lost the rest of my project, here is what I was able to find. Once I have some more free time, I will be revisiting this and rebuilding it.
